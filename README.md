## Completed Assignments

### Module 1: Introduction to MLOps

In this module, I created a linear regression model to predict the duration of taxi trips in NYC using Yellow Taxi Trip Records from January and February 2023. The assignment involved:

- Loading and exploring Yellow Taxi Trip data
- Computing trip durations and handling outliers
- Implementing one-hot encoding for categorical features
- Training a linear regression model
- Evaluating the model on both training and validation datasets

Tools & Libraries used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter notebooks

### Module 2: Experiment Tracking and Model Registry

In this module, I implemented experiment tracking and model management using MLflow. The assignment focused on:

- Setting up MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning
- Processing NYC Green Taxi Trip data for January to March 2023
- Training RandomForestRegressor models with MLflow autologging
- Running hyperparameter optimization with hyperopt
- Setting up a local MLflow tracking server with SQLite backend
- Managing model lifecycle using MLflow Model Registry
- Evaluating and selecting the best model based on validation metrics

Tools & Libraries used:
- MLflow (version 1.27.0)
- Hyperopt for hyperparameter tuning
- scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
- Pandas, NumPy
- SQLite for MLflow backend storage

### Module 3: Orchestration and ML Pipelines

In this module, I implemented workflow orchestration for the NYC taxi trip duration prediction project using Prefect. The work involved:

- Building an end-to-end ML pipeline with Prefect tasks and flows
- Implementing automated data preparation and model training processes
- Setting up Prefect deployments with scheduling capabilities
- Integrating MLflow tracking within the Prefect workflow
- Containerizing the entire workflow with Docker for reproducibility
- Creating monitoring utilities for tracking model performance
- Implementing error handling and retry mechanisms for workflow reliability
- Setting up a complete MLOps environment with both Prefect server and workers

Tools & Libraries used:
- Prefect 3.x for workflow orchestration
- Docker for containerization
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- scikit-learn for modeling
- Shell scripts for automation

### Module 4: Model Deployment

In this module, I implemented batch deployment strategies for the NYC taxi trip duration prediction model. The assignment focused on:

- Converting Jupyter notebooks to production-ready Python scripts
- Building a parameterized batch scoring system for different time periods
- Containerizing the model with Docker for portable execution
- Integrating cloud storage options for prediction results (AWS S3, GCS, Azure)
- Creating an orchestrated batch workflow using Prefect
- Implementing a complete deployment pipeline from data ingestion to result storage
- Designing a flexible system that can handle different data sources and output formats

Tools & Libraries used:
- Docker for containerization
- Prefect for workflow orchestration
- Cloud storage SDKs (boto3, google-cloud-storage)
- pandas for data processing
- scikit-learn for model inference

## Setup and Installation

This project uses Python 3.10+ and the following dependencies as defined in the `pyproject.toml` file:


The project uses the `uv` package manager for faster dependency resolution and installation:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment using uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -e .

# The dependencies are locked in the uv.lock file for reproducibility
```

## Future Modules

I'll be adding more modules as I progress through the course:
- Module 5: Model monitoring
- Module 6: Best practices
